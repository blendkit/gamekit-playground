# gamekit-playground

getting started
---------------

* Download this repository
* Startup blender: File=>User Preferences=>Add-Ons=>Install from File=>[navigate to the playground-folder's blender-addon] and choose blenderaddon.zip or the experimental version.
* Select gamekit-renderer. On top where you see "Blender Render" choose "Gamekit".
* On the Render-Panel under "Gamekit Runtime" choose the runtime file-icon and navigate to the playground=>runtimes=>your os=>**AppOgreKit** or **AppOgreKit.exe**  
(**Sorry for not supporting mac-OSX at the moment**! I did try a complete night and day to get it to work. Without success. You can use wine on the windows-version though. Installing wine via brew did work for me)
* Save your blend before starting the engine. Otherwise it will not work...
